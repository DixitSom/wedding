# Photo Gallery Instructions

To add your three photos to the wedding website:

1. Place your three photos in this `images` folder
2. Rename them as follows:
   - `photo1.jpg` - Will appear in the "Our First Meet" slot
   - `photo2.jpg` - Will appear in the "Proposal Day" slot
   - `photo3.jpg` - Will appear in the "Engagement" slot

## Supported Image Formats
- .jpg or .jpeg
- .png
- .webp

## Tips for Best Results
- Use square or nearly square images (1:1 aspect ratio works best)
- Recommended size: at least 800x800 pixels
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 2MB each) for faster loading

## What if my images have different names or formats?
If your images have different names (e.g., "wedding_pic.png"), you have two options:

**Option 1: Rename your files**
Simply rename your files to match: `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, `photo3.jpg`

**Option 2: Update the HTML**
Open `index.html` and update the image paths on lines with `src="images/..."` to match your actual filenames.

Example: Change `src="images/photo1.jpg"` to `src="images/your-actual-filename.png"`
